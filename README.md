# RAG Movie Recommendation Chatbot

## Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Movie Recommendation Chatbot is an intelligent system designed to provide personalized anime recommendations based on user input. By leveraging the capabilities of LanceDB for semantic search and OpenAI’s embedding models, this chatbot retrieves and processes relevant data to deliver accurate and contextual recommendations. The chatbot supports customization options, allowing users to fine-tune the recommendation process based on genres, ratings, and popularity.

### Description of the Workflow:
1. **Documents:** The system starts by processing a dataset containing information about various anime, including titles, genres, synopses, and scores.
2. **Chunks:** The dataset is broken down into smaller, manageable chunks to facilitate efficient processing and embedding generation.
3. **OpenAI Embedding Model:** Each chunk is then passed through an OpenAI embedding model that converts the textual information into numerical vectors, capturing the semantic meaning of the content.
4. **Vectors:** These vectors are stored and indexed in LanceDB, a high-performance vector database optimized for semantic search.
5. **User Prompt:** When a user provides a query, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant chunks from LanceDB based on the semantic similarity to the user’s input.
6. **Retrieved Chunks:** The retrieved chunks are then processed and used to generate a contextual response.
7. **Response:** Finally, the chatbot provides the user with a list of recommended anime titles, along with a brief synopsis and the reasons for the recommendations.
